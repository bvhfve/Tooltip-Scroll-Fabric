#Note
Release page for the (Tooltip Scroll mod for Fabric)[https://github.com/turtletowerz/Tooltip-Scroll-Fabric]. I do not own, create or modify the code of this mod. 
This is just the unofficial release page, where I compile and publish versions that people may want and should have been released.

# Tooltip Scroll
Allows item tooltips to be moved via the scrollwheel.

## Instructions
Place the .jar file into your fabric mods folder.

Use the scrollwheel or the Page-Up and Page-Down keys to move tooltips up and down while hovering over an item.
Holding left-shift makes the tooltip move left and right instead.
